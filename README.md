# Mercury Limits Data Analysis Project (Python and Jupyter Notebook)
Melea Mendrin

The purpose of this project is help city officials determine the health impact of elevated mercury levels in local water supply. With the estimates and data analysis performed in this project, city officials will be better equipped to keep the public safe and provide reasonable recommendations regarding fish consumption in the city.

### Introduction
Mercury is a toxic substance that can become harmful or potentially fatal when it accumulates in the body in high amounts over time. Due to this, I am prompted to evaluate the possible elevated levels of mercury in a cityâ€™s water supply by modeling the levels of mercury an individual accumulates from eating fish from the local water supply. Since individuals who consume fish from this water supply may be at risk for mercury poisoning, by modeling this presence of mercury, it can be determined how much fish is safe to consume.
